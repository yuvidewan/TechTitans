How to Use This Script
Place Files Together: Make sure your dataset CSV file (e.g., DSL-StrongPasswordData.csv) is in the same folder as the Python script (keystroke_model.py).

Install Necessary Libraries: You'll need to install a few libraries if you don't have them already. 

Update the Filename: Open the analytic.py script and change the DATASET_FILENAME variable at the bottom to match the name of your CSV file.

Run the Script: Execute the script from your terminal:

python analytic.py

What the Script Does (A Deeper Dive)
This script creates a complete machine learning pipeline for user authentication based on typing patterns.

Loads and Prepares Data: It reads your CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

Encodes Labels: Machine learning models require numerical inputs. LabelEncoder converts the text-based user IDs (like 's002', 's003') into numbers (0, 1, 2, etc.).

Splits the Data: It divides your data into a training set (75%) and a testing set (25%). The model learns from the training set and is then evaluated on the unseen testing set to see how well it performs on new data. stratify is used to ensure that each user is fairly represented in both sets.

Scales Features: StandardScaler standardizes all the timing features. This is a critical step that prevents features with larger values (like longer time delays) from unfairly dominating the model's learning process.

Trains an XGBoost Model:

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a highly effective and widely used algorithm. It builds a series of "weak" decision trees, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. This ensemble method results in a very strong and accurate final model.

The parameters are set for a multi-class classification task, which is exactly what "identifying a user out of many" is.

Evaluates Performance:

Accuracy: Gives a single score for the overall percentage of correct predictions.

Classification Report: Provides a more detailed breakdown, showing the precision, recall, and f1-score for each individual user. This helps you see if the model is good at identifying all users, or if it struggles with specific ones.

Confusion Matrix: A heatmap is generated and saved as confusion_matrix.png. This visualizes the model's performance. The diagonal shows correct predictions. Any values off the diagonal show where the model made a mistake (e.g., it predicted a typing sample from 's002' actually belonged to 's005').

Saves the Model (.pkl files):

The script saves the trained model, the scaler, and the label_encoder. This is crucial for a real-world application. You can now write a separate, much simpler script that just loads these files and makes a prediction on a new typing sample, without needing to retrain the entire model every time.

This comprehensive approach will give you a high-accuracy model that is ready to be integrated into a real fraud detection system.
